    summary: Operationalized training cycles and deployments of machine learning models.
    highlights:
      - Developed Docker Swarm stacks for deployment of MLOps services, including
        a model registry (MLFlow); databases (Postgres and Redis); a reverse‐proxy
        (Traefik) with an authentication service; a workflow orchestrator (Prefect);
        Grafana and Prometheus.
      - Designed an on‐prem MLOps solution to provide end‐to‐end services for frictionless
        training, validation, deployment and monitoring of ML models based on Open‐Source
        software, including a CI/CD component for ML.
      - Designed a workflow template using DVC for Data Scientists to confidently
        develop datasets and models with unit testing integrating a CI/CD pipeline
        written in GitLab CI/CD specification.
      - Developing a schema validation suite with Great Expectations to test data
        integrity from a Data Warehouse.
      - Wrote tests and GitLab CI pipelines for deployment of thoroughly tested models
        on their data and performance. Wrote Gitlab CI pipelines for automated deployment
        of Docker Stacks.
      - Deployed a Kubernetes cluster including Istio Ingress Gateway and Seldon CRDs
        for model deployment and monitoring.
      - Optimized performance of data queries and transformations using optimized
        memory formats Apache Arrow and DuckDB.
